Only, only
Only trust two godspeeds
Love me, love me
You make it far too easy
I see, see, see
Top of tree, it's three
Put your body on my jeans
(Put your body on my jeans)
Double C's, double cheats
Double trust within me
Double kiss in a dream, mmm
Double tricks up my sleeve, yeah
Double checks in my jeans, yeah
Double texts when I leave
You ask me where I'm going
Going, where I'm going
(I'll take you with me, baby)
Goin', in', in', in',
I hope you notice
Only, only
Only trust two godspeeds
Love me, love me
You make it far too easy
I see, see, see
Top of tree, it's three
Put your body on my jeans
(Put your body on my jeans)
Put your body on my jeans
Put your body on my jeans
Put your body on my jeans
I let it come to me
Put your money
where your mouth be
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Keep on trying me
Poke it, get the horns
You laughing at me
What the fuck you want?
Keep on trying me
You gonna get fucked up
Keep on trying me,
keep on trying me (Ayy, ayy)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, a-)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Jeans
Put your body on my, jeans
Jeans
Jeans
Only, only
Only trust two godspeeds
Love me, love me
You make it far too easy
(Put your body on my jeans)
I see, see, see
Top of tree, it's three
Put your body on my jeans
(Put your body on my jeans)
